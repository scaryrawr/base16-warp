# Base16 Warp

These are [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) colorschemes for [warp](https://www.warp.dev/).

They are generated using [base16-builder-go](https://github.com/tinted-theming/base16-builder-go). Which uses their collection of [schemes](https://github.com/tinted-theming/schemes).

## Installation

There's probably better ways to install this, but for me, I just do:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scaryrawr/base16-warp $HOME/.warp
```

The main goal is just to have the `themes` directory at `$HOME/.warp/themes`.

Then quit warp and restart it.
